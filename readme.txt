The Javascript is based on Arvind Satyanarayan example which toggles the visibility of multiple  elements on a page, see it at http://blog.movalog.com/a/javascript-toggle-visibility/
Most of the code has been adapted from the collapsible_element plugin by ..::DeUCeD::..

== KEEP IN MIND ==

This plugin is tested in my installation only. That means you must better test it before you use it even though it doesn't seem to interfere with other plugins. As far as i know it is compatible with all the plugins i use and you could check mines at my plugins page. But i recommend that you deactivate any plugins that do a similar job aiming the same purpose. As we all know, BACKUP AND TRY IT BEFORE YOU USE IT! You are the only responsible person for your DATA.
